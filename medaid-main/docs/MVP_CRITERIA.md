  - Measure bundle size → confirms <200KB target
- **Success Metric**: 100% core features work offline

## 🔍 Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Network Conditions
- **Slow/intermittent connection**: Progressive loading, graceful degradation
- **Complete offline**: Cached responses, local-only features
- **High latency**: Loading states, timeout handling

### Device Limitations
- **Old Android devices**: Polyfills for missing APIs
- **Limited storage**: Cache eviction strategies
- **Low RAM**: Lazy loading, memory optimization

### User Input Edge Cases
- **Long voice input**: Chunk processing, timeout handling
- **Mixed languages**: Language detection, appropriate responses
- **Medical emergencies**: Escalation to emergency services
- **Gibberish input**: Input validation, helpful error messages

### Accessibility Edge Cases
- **Screen readers**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML
- **High contrast mode**: Color scheme adaptation
- **Large text**: Responsive typography
- **Motor disabilities**: Large touch targets, voice alternatives
